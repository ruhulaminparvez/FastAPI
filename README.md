# FastAPI âš¡

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:
 - Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
 - Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
 - Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
 - Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
 - Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
 - Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
 - Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
 - Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
